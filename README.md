### Hi there, anyone who is seeing my profile.
I'm a Full Stack Developer with knowledge of React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js

My journey started when I discovered freeCodeCamp and quickly developed a passion for programming. I began by building small projects and gradually developed more complex applications. Early on, I recreated Frontend Mentor designs, and later I built a replica of the classic Duck Hunt game and developed a mock e-commerce site based on a Figma community design.

Currently, I'm working on two projects:

- Yabook – a social media platform

- Art Museum – a space for artists to share and showcase their work
