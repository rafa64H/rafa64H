### Hi there, anyone who is seeing my profile.

I'm learning frontend web development, currently I know React, Typescript and tailwind,
in the future I'll learn NEXTJS.

I started learning frontend when I knew about freeCodeCamp and liked programming, I made
some small projects and made other bigger ones (firstly frontend mentor pages, later 
I replicated the duck-hunt game and made the crisp-ecommerce page from a figma design).

I'm currently making a social media to show what I know, the page is called "yabook"
(I swear I didn't copy the name from yahoo and facebook ðŸ˜…).
