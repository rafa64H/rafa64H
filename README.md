### Hi there, anyone who is seeing my profile.

I am a Jr. Frontend developer, currently I have knowledge of React, Typescript and tailwind and Nodejs/express

I started learning frontend when I knew about freeCodeCamp, I started liking programming so I made some small projects and made other bigger ones (firstly frontend mentor pages, later I replicated the duck-hunt game and made the crisp-ecommerce page from a figma design, my projects in process today are the social media of yabook and art-museum which is a webpage to post art).
